What is PWAS?
=============

Proteome-Wide Association Study (PWAS) is a protein-centric, gene-based method for conducting genetic association studies. PWAS detects proteins whose functional variability is correlated with a given phenotype across a cohort. It employs a machine-learning model to assess the functional damage caused to each protein within each sample (given the sample's genotype).
